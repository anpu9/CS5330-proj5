## 📌 Tasks

### TaskA 

The MNIST dataset is loaded using `load_mnist_test_data`, and the first 6 digits are visualized by calling `plot_mnist_samples`. Both steps are executed in the `main` function.

### TaskB

The CNN architecture is implemented in the `MyCNNNetwork` class. All layers are defined in the `__init__` method, and the `forward` method specifies how the input flows through those layers.

Please use this network in the training process.
